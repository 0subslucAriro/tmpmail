## How to Use Windows Home Server 2011
 
To use Windows Home Server 2011, you need to connect your other computers and devices to your home network and install the Windows Home Server Connector software on them. This software allows you to access your home server, backup your data, restore files, and manage settings.
 
You can download the Windows Home Server Connector software from your home server's website. To access it, open a web browser on any computer connected to your home network and type http://servername or http://servername/connect, where servername is the name of your home server.

You can also use the Windows Home Server Launchpad to access your home server's features quickly. The Launchpad is a small application that runs in the system tray of your computers and devices. It lets you launch the Dashboard, backup or restore files, access shared folders, stream media, and remotely connect to your home server or other computers on your network.
