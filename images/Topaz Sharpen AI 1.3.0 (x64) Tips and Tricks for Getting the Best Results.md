Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) can handle a variety of situations where your photos might suffer from blur, softness, or noise. Whether you are dealing with motion blur from a shaky camera or a moving subject, lens blur from missed focus, or softness from low-quality optics or high ISO settings, Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) can help you restore the clarity and detail of your images.
 
Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) features three main processing modes: Sharpen, Stabilize, and Focus. Each mode has its own set of sliders that let you adjust the intensity of the effect and fine-tune the results. You can also preview the before and after images side by side or in split view to see the difference.
 
Sharpen mode is designed to give your already-good images that extra pop while making sure they look natural. It works best on finely detailed features like eyes, feathers, leaves, and stars. Stabilize mode is aimed at reducing motion blur caused by camera shake or subject movement. It can often save images that you would otherwise discard due to blur. Focus mode is intended to correct lens blur caused by missed focus or shallow depth of field. It can sometimes recover images that are slightly out of focus and bring back the sharpness.
 
Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) is a standalone application that works on Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 systems. It requires a modern PC with multi-core processors, large amounts of RAM, and a fast GPU for optimal performance. You can buy it for $79.99 or try it for free for 30 days from the official website.
 
Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) is a powerful image sharpener that can produce natural results with no artifacts or halos. If you want to improve the quality of your photos and make them pop with more impact and emotion, you should give it a try.

Topaz Sharpen AI 1.3.0 (x64) also allows you to selectively apply the sharpening effect to specific areas of your image using masks. You can use the auto-detect mask feature to let the software identify the main subject of your photo and apply the sharpening only to it, or you can manually paint the mask using the brush tool. You can also invert the mask to sharpen the background instead of the foreground, or use the erase tool to remove unwanted parts of the mask.

They have praised its ability to fix blurry photos and enhance details without creating unnatural artifacts or halos. They have also appreciated its ease of use and integration with other photo editing software.
